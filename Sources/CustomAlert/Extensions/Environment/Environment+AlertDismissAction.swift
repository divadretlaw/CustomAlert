    /// Don't call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it for you when you
    /// call the ``AlertDismissAction`` structure that you get from the
    /// `Environment`:

    /// private struct SheetContents: View {
    ///     @Environment(\.alertDismiss) private var alertDismiss
    ///
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         Button("Done") {
    ///             alertDismiss() // Implicitly calls dismiss.callAsFunction()
    ///         }
    ///     }
    /// }
